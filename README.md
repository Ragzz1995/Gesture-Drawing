# Gesture-Drawing
Use any object as Paint brush and Draw by moving it in the air.
The object that you wish to use must be cropped properly and stored as temp.png.
Confidence value has to be calibrated properly using max_val value. The higher the value the greater is the match, so keep a pretty reasonable confidance value.
